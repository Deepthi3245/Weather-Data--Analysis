# Weather Data Analysis and Visualization

This project fetches weather data for multiple cities using OpenWeatherMap's API, processes it, stores it in a SQLite database, and creates insightful visualizations.

## Features
- Retrieve live weather data (temperature, humidity, wind speed, and conditions).
- Store data in a SQLite database with timestamp tracking to avoid duplicates.
- Save data as CSV for easy analysis.
- Generate bar charts to compare weather conditions visually.
- Automate script execution with Windows Task Scheduler.

## Technologies
- **Python**: Data extraction, transformation, and automation.
- **Pandas**: Data handling and processing.
- **SQLite**: Database storage and management.
- **Matplotlib**: Visualization.
- **Task Scheduler**: Automation (Windows).
